These are examples of abstract data type classes that my partners and I created. 
I was designated as team lead and was the driver during coding. The code was written
using MS Visual Studio and was turned by connecting into a Linux terminal and creating 
a make file and then submitting. 

For the group work we used Google Hangouts to share our screens and work together. Our files
would be saved on the shcools linux system where we could all access them through a Linux
Terminal.

This course was a lot of fun. Although the coding is not perfect, I am proud of what we
accomplished. We spent the majority of our time working on the assignments and making sure
that hey passed the testBed.
